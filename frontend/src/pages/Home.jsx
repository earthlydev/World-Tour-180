	    	<p>World Tour 180 provides travel services to clients for global journeys and around-the-world trips in under 180 days.</p>
	    	<br/>
	    	<p>Globally, there are roughly 800 airlines that take off and land at almost 9,000 airports. In 2023, there were approximately 8.7 billion passenger movements in airports worldwide. This includes takeoffs, landings, and transfers. With numbers this high, a database is the only practical solution as something as simple as a spreadsheet could not handle the amount of data contained and simultaneous agent access is required.</p>
